## How to play MIO Virtual Pet

When the program starts, the game will ask you to create a pet:

1. First pick the pet type you would like to create: Organic or Robotic.
2. Enter the species of your pet.
3. Enter the name of your pet.
4. Enter the color of your pet.

Once your pet is created, you will be at the main menu.

7. Remove your pet

Press Q to quit

From this menu, the player has option to pick any of these listed options.

Option 1:
"Create a new pet" 
Allows the player to create a brand new organic or robotic pet. The player is allowed to type the species, name, and the color of the pet. The player can create as many pets as they prefer.

# Virtual Pets Re-Imagined
## Overview
Do you remember Cyberpet? Tamagotchi? Digimon? Petz? Virtual pets like these were born in 1996. With your help, they will be reborn. Virtual Toys, Inc. wants you to build the next iteration of virtual pets to market to adults who enjoy updated versions of the toys and games they played in their youth.  This game will be like the virtual pets of 1996...but so much more. It’s Virtual Pets Re-Imagined with your own personal touch!

## General Requirements

Your Virtual Pet program must be a console application. The application must have a main menu where a user can create a pet. The pet must have a name and species. The pet will also feature properties such as hunger, boredom, and health. A user should be able to view these properties from the main menu. A user should also be able to interact with the pet. The pet will be affected by a method that will represent time (Tick) that will negatively affect the pet and therefore incentivize the use of other methods to care for the pet.

Your application must then be adapted to include a Shelter that will house multiple pets. You can move the create a pet function to the Shelter or leave it as a part of the main program. From the Shelter menu options you should be able to interact with 1 pet, or all pets. You should be able to check on the status of 1 pet as well as all pets simultaneously.

Your application should also make use of the Virtual-Pet-Tests project and test some of your models and methods. Remember: Red, green, refactor. If that confused you. Make sure to review TDD or ask us in class! We're here to help.


---- 

## Grading
The VirtualPet.Tests project includes a PetTests class with completed tests. These are the tests that will prove that the code you write in the Pet class is correct. Therefore, it is the logical starting point! The first test Pet_Constructor_Should_Instantiate_Pet_Object() has been written for you, and it passes because you already have a Pet class and can create a Pet object. The remaining tests have been written, but are commented out. Uncomment the code of the first test and add source code to the Pet class to pass the test. Continue with the tests, one by one, and add code until all the tests pass. 

If you want to focus on TDD, you can write your code by writing tests first. (This is optional, but the tests that are already written for you are not. They must pass.) If you do so, each public method you write would have a unit test that covers its behavior. The test classes would also be well maintained and follow the principles of clean code.   

In order to receive a PASSING grade, all of the following principles must be met:

- Tests include appropriate Arrange, Act, and Assert sections.
- All tests pass.
- All features from iterations 1, 2, and 3 are implemented.

## Iteration 1

- Start with a pet class. Then use the Pet class and the Program class to do the following tasks:
  - NOTE: Start with the Pet class and use TDD in the Test project provided to set up the properties and methods of your pet class. Make all tests pass before continuing. 
  - An interactive user interface (in short, make a menu)
  - Ability for players to enter the game, play as long as they’d like, and leave the game when they want
  - Ability for players to create a pet by putting in a name and species for said pet
  - Ability for players to see the current status of a pet, such as hunger, boredom, and health (hint: class properties)
  - Ability for players to interact with pet, such as feed, play, and take to doctor (hint: class methods)
  - As players interact with pet, the pet’s status changes
  - As "time" ticks by, the pet's status changes negatively

## Iteration 2

- Create a shelter class to house your pets
- Ability for players to admit (or add) pets into the shelter or adopt (or remove) them out of the shelter
- Ability for players to see a list of all pets in the shelter
- Ability for players to see the current status of all pets at once, such as hunger, boredom, and health
- Ability for players to choose to interact with one pet or multiple pets, such as feed, play, and take to doctor

## Iteration 3

- Player’s choice of adding, interacting, or adopting either organic or robotic pets
- As players interact with pets, the pet’s status changes differently for organic and robotic pets (overriding methods)
- As "time" ticks by, the pets' status changes negatively. The passing of time is measured by how often the player interacts with the program.
- Eventually rename this INSTRUCTIONS.md and create your own README.md file with instructions on how to play the game

# Extra
Did you know that you could change the color of text in console applications and add sounds? That's pretty cool, and a decent way to add some flair to your project if you get finished early. (From Gavin: AND ONLY IF YOU GET FINISHED EARLY! Also, there are sounds, which I think are pretty cool. Might be a fun thing to try out!)
